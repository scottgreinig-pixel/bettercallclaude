<p align="center"><strong>Swiss Legal Intelligence Plugin for Cowork Desktop</strong></p>

BetterCallClaude transforms legal research, case strategy, and document drafting for Swiss lawyers. It provides deep integration with Swiss legal databases, multi-lingual analysis (DE/FR/IT/EN), and built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege) protection -- 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills, and 7 MCP servers covering BGE/ATF/DTF precedent research, litigation strategy, adversarial analysis, legal drafting, and citation verification across all 26 Swiss cantons.

> **Claude Code CLI users**: this repository is Cowork Desktop only. The CLI version is at [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

## Overview

BetterCallClaude provides a structured methodology for handling legal work with AI assistance. The framework consists of five interconnected phases.

## What's New in v4.3.0

**v4.3.0 — Cowork upload hardening release.** The v4.2.x zip was rejected by Cowork's server-side plugin validator with a generic toast. Bisected against 11 micro-zips and fixed three distinct manifest issues:

- **`userConfig` schema completed** — every entry now declares `type`, `title`, and `default` as required by Anthropic's Zod validator.
- **Skill frontmatter completed** — all 14 `skills/*/SKILL.md` now include the required `name:` field (previously only `description:` was set; the local `claude plugin validate` CLI does not crawl skill frontmatter).
- **Gateway URLs hardcoded in `.mcp.json`** — Cowork rejects `${user_config.*}` inside `url:` fields because validation runs before the user is prompted (see anthropic/claude-code#39455). URLs to `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` and `mcp.opencaselaw.ch` are now baked in; self-hosters fork and edit `.mcp.json` directly. `${user_config.*}` still works in `env:`, `args:`, and `headers:` blocks.
- **Privacy hook hardened** — covers `MCP`, `MultiEdit`, and `WebFetch` tools; weak markers (bare `confidential`, `vertraulich`) gated on a corroborating signal to reduce false positives.
- **Agent model tiers pinned** — every agent frontmatter now declares its `model:` explicitly (haiku/sonnet/opus); orchestrator and briefing agents gained the `Task` tool so they can actually spawn subagents.
- **MCP shared code disambiguated** — resolved duplicate `CacheRepository` class; raw-SQL variant renamed `SqliteCacheRepository`.
- **Docs** — added `docs/PRIVACY.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`; refreshed plugin README; removed dead `install-claude-desktop.sh`.
- **CI** — lint no longer `continue-on-error`; added HTTP server job; engines/TypeScript versions aligned across packages.

**Content counts unchanged**: 20 agents, 19 commands (+1 `/version` infra command), 14 skills, 7 MCP servers (6 remote + 1 local STDIO ollama).

[Full changelog →](CHANGELOG.md)

**Cowork Desktop dedicated release** -- This repository is exclusively for Claude Cowork Desktop. The Claude Code CLI version is at [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

- **HTTP-only transport**: 6 of 7 MCP servers connect via `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` / `mcp.opencaselaw.ch` -- no local Node.js build required for those
- **Local STDIO server** (`ollama`): bundled and only touches `http://localhost:11434` for privacy-routed translation/summarisation
- **Simplified setup**: `/setup` checks connectivity only -- no transport switching needed in Cowork

## Key Features

- **Briefing sessions** -- Complex queries trigger a collaborative intake phase with specialist panels, targeted questions, and structured execution plans before agents start working. Supports `--resume` for cross-session persistence.
- **Adversarial analysis** -- Three-agent workflow: advocate builds the case, adversary challenges it, judicial analyst synthesizes using Swiss Erwagung methodology with probability scores.
- **Multi-agent workflows** -- Predefined pipelines for due diligence, litigation prep, contract lifecycle, and real estate closings.
- **All 26 cantons** -- Full cantonal coverage with court systems, citation formats, and MCP search via entscheidsuche.ch. Federal law is the default; mentioning a canton triggers cantonal mode.
- **Multi-language** -- Automatic language detection for DE/FR/IT/EN with correct legal terminology and citation formats.

See [CONNECTORS.md](bettercallclaude/CONNECTORS.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Privacy

BetterCallClaude includes built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege, Art. 321 StGB) compliance. A `PreToolUse` hook scans outgoing tool calls for privilege indicators in German (Anwaltsgeheimnis, Mandantengeheimnis, vertraulich), French (secret professionnel, confidentiel), and Italian (segreto professionale, confidenziale).

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | All external calls require confirmation. Local processing preferred via Ollama. |
| `balanced` | Privileged content triggers confirmation. Non-privileged content processed normally. |
| `cloud` | Standard cloud processing with privacy hook active for explicit privilege markers only. |

---

## Language Support

| Language | Code | Legal Context |
|----------|------|---------------|
| German | DE | Primary: ZGB, OR, StGB, BGE. Used in ZH, BE, BS, and German-speaking cantons. |

## For Developers

This repo contains the plugin only (agents, commands, skills, hooks, `.mcp.json`, and the bundled `ollama` local STDIO server). MCP server source code and the HTTP aggregator deployed to Railway at `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` live in the separate [`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP) repo.

```bash
npm run package        # Create distributable plugin zip
```

To change an MCP server's behaviour, open a PR in
[`fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP`](https://github.com/fedec65/BetterCallClaudeMCP).
Railway auto-redeploys on merge to `main`.

See [CONNECTORS.md](bettercallclaude/CONNECTORS.md) for MCP server API documentation and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow.
