<p align="center"><strong>Swiss Legal Intelligence Plugin for Cowork Desktop</strong></p>

BetterCallClaude transforms legal research, case strategy, and document drafting for Swiss lawyers. It provides deep integration with Swiss legal databases, multi-lingual analysis (DE/FR/IT/EN), and built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege) protection -- 20 agents, 19 commands, 14 skills, and 7 MCP servers covering BGE/ATF/DTF precedent research, litigation strategy, adversarial analysis, legal drafting, and citation verification across all 26 Swiss cantons.

> **Claude Code CLI users**: this repository is Cowork Desktop only. The CLI version is at [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

## What's New in v4.2.0

**Cowork Desktop dedicated release** -- This repository is now exclusively for Claude Cowork Desktop. The Claude Code CLI version has been split into a separate repository: [fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli](https://github.com/fedec65/bettercallclaude-cli).

- **HTTP-only transport**: all 7 MCP servers connect via `mcp.bettercallclaude.ch` or SSE -- no local Node.js build required
- **Full plugin manifest**: `plugin.json` at plugin root per Anthropic official format
- **Simplified setup**: `/setup` checks connectivity only -- no transport switching needed in Cowork

## Key Features

- **Briefing sessions** -- Complex queries trigger a collaborative intake phase with specialist panels, targeted questions, and structured execution plans before agents start working. Supports `--resume` for cross-session persistence.
- **Adversarial analysis** -- Three-agent workflow: advocate builds the case, adversary challenges it, judicial analyst synthesizes using Swiss Erwagung methodology with probability scores.
- **Multi-agent workflows** -- Predefined pipelines for due diligence, litigation prep, contract lifecycle, and real estate closings.
- **All 26 cantons** -- Full cantonal coverage with court systems, citation formats, and MCP search via entscheidsuche.ch. Federal law is the default; mentioning a canton triggers cantonal mode.
- **Multi-language** -- Automatic language detection for DE/FR/IT/EN with correct legal terminology and citation formats.

## Privacy

BetterCallClaude includes built-in Anwaltsgeheimnis (attorney-client privilege, Art. 321 StGB) compliance. A `PreToolUse` hook scans outgoing tool calls for privilege indicators in German (Anwaltsgeheimnis, Mandantengeheimnis, vertraulich), French (secret professionnel, confidentiel), and Italian (segreto professionale, confidenziale).

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | All external calls require confirmation. Local processing preferred via Ollama. |
| `balanced` | Privileged content triggers confirmation. Non-privileged content processed normally. |
| `cloud` | Standard cloud processing with privacy hook active for explicit privilege markers only. |
